# About Me

Hi, I'm Pakawat Nakwijit (please call me **TK**). I'm currently a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof. Matthew Purver](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~mpurver/) at Queen Mary University of London (start in September 2020).

I'm interested in Natural Language Processing and its applications in Thai langauge. Currently, I'm working on how to leverage the pre-trained language models that mostly trained with English for solving downstream tasks in Thai. Moreover, I'm also interested in Mathematics, and Philosophy in general.

Before that, I worked as a web developer in a small company named Maxile co. ltd. I developed various kinds of website: an online magazine, an data-intensive site used to collecte TBs of data and generate hundreds of reports and also a mobile application based on web technology.

In my spare time, I play a lot of boardgames [[BGG account](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/chameleontk)] and enjoy sharing my passion for learning how things work through my own blog. I am trying to translate useful resurces to Thai as many as possible because I found that it will be a good starting point to many young Thai students.
