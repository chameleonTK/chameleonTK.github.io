What do you do when you wake up and realize that today is your birthday? When I was a boy, I looked forward to my birthday. There was a big party with my family. We sang songs, eat and drink a lot (not alcohol). It was the happiest and most memorable time. I didn't even know when I started crying on my birthday.

Because of my expectation, on my birthday, everything went wrong. I found that so many people usually forget about other's birthday. Getting up, working and going home. It was just an ordinary day for them. It really grieved me. After the internet gradually overcome our life, people use their phone to remind about their beloved's birthday. We lose our classical moment which your friends says "HBD to you" because of their intention, not a reminder.

Now, Facebook becomes our big brother and makes me even sadder. Every time when I saw someone who I have never talked to, posted about my birthday, I felt like it was just a flattery.

A few years ago, one of my friends said to me "Just because someone doesn’t actually remember your day does not mean they do not value you". He also told me that you cannot force other do what you want them to do. It will hurt both of you and your friends. These facts slap in my face. Everyone has their own work and desire. Open your mind and look closer. Your birthday isn't a special day for everyone. They didn't have a lot of free time to pay attention to every detail of you. Your friends keep you in their heart. They didn't forget about you. You are definitely able to count on them as you always are.

Look in the past. I ask myself why did like that. One of the answers is fear of not belonging. I am afraid of being lost. Thank to my friend mentioned earlier, He shows that I am not alone in this world.

This year, I wake up with a big smile. Like other years, there are several calls to wish me a happy birthday and I truly glad to hear it. And the unsurprising news was that there were a lot of my friends who forgot. It had two options for me, got angry with them or not. I decided not to get angry. I got through it. It turned out to be the most beautiful day I have experienced in a long time.

After that day, I later found that they didn't forget. They were quite busy guys. Thank to them, thank to my family, thank to everyone. I know all of you value me although you forget my birthday.

PS. Last year, my dad surprised me with his video that he created by himself. It is good time for me to start looking forward to my next birthday.
