## TL;DR
When was your first lie? I also cannot actually answer it. This ability was developed since you were a kid. When we grow up, The lies seem to be an ordinary thing in our society. Everyone lie to each other in every day because they have to protect themselves from harm behind the truth.

There is one lie that turns me into me. When I was a kid, I was raised by my parents. I am very close with my mother. I spent almost of my weekend with her. On that day, my mother gave me five baht to buy snacks. I was joyful because it meant that I would have snacks for the whole afternoon. However, after I was playing with my cat, that coin disappeared. Of course, I felt really bad and guilty.

Shortly thereafter, My mom asked me for that coin. I did not know why she asked for it but I really know that it had gone. I was afraid of being punished so I decided to lie to her. Indeed, She knew everything because she found the coin in the bathroom after I took a shower. She told me the truth and taught me about consequences after we lied. It made me cry. I cried a lot. I tried to apologize her. It was terrible to lie because It can change you into a trouble maker. If you lie once, It will be easier for the second time.

<div class="blockquote">

Don't lie to everyone again. It is easy to lie but It is hard for everyone to build trust on you. You have to be courage to face the problem which you have done
― My lovely mother</div>

She did not punish me and she bought a snack for me. It is a memorable time.
Love you, mom
