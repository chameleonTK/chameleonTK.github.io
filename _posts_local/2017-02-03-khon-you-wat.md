## TL;DR
Khon You Wat is a very tiny book that contains around 15 chapters. It was written about experience of many boys who use their life in temple. I love it so much and hope you will read it soon.

Throughout my life, There are many important things that change my perspective. One of them is Books. Because I have grown up with so many books. Since I remembered, My mother took me to library and book store every weekend. I spent a lot of time reading a lot of books. It has slowly become a part of my life.

In the beginning, I admit that I don't actually read them. I always read them through illustration and first few paragraphs of that book. Because of that, I hardly ever read them till the end. sadly~

My very first book, which has a lot of text and less picture, that I read entire of it is the short story named "Khon You Wat" (คนอยู่วัด). It is graded readers in my high school. In that time, I started reading in the evening and I was reading, reading and reading. After the last chapter, I realised that it was lately morning. I love it so much and I still remember the feeling of that time as well.

Khon You Wat is a very tiny book that has around 15 chapters. It is strange because most graded readers are very huge and outdated story with boring stuff.

The story is about experience of many boys who spend their life in a temple which is the true story of the author, "Mithree Lippichat"(ไมตรี ลิปปิชาติ). He wrote all of these chapters with simple and straight words so It is very easy to imagine and follow his thought.

"Khon You Wat" brings me to see the The daily struggle of living. This story tells complex situation with optimistic view. All of these boys do everything to make them and their family happy so that they have to face with dramatic problems. There are different ways to solve their problems and all of them are correct in some views.
And finally all of them also have to go their separate way.
